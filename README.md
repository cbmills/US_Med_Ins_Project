# US_Med_Ins_Project
## For Codecademy Data Scientist Course
This project breaks down a population of individuals by factors such as age, sex, BMI, the number of children insured individuals have, smoking habits, and the region in which a person lives by their average insurance costs. This project then ranks the average insurance cost of each sub population and compares it to the average insurance cost of the entire population. 

From this analysis, we can make some broad level conclusions about how each factor may affect an individuals insurance cost. However, there are more than just one or two factors that affect an individuals insurance cost, so a more detailed analysis could be completed with the information gathered here.
